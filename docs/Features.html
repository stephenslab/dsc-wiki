<p>The SoS format is highly readable with almost verbatim inclusion of scripts in other languages. Anyone, including those who have no idea about SoS, would be able to read and modify workflows written in SoS format. This makes SoS an idea tool for the sharing of workflows with others, and for the creation of workflows that would be frequently updated for newer versions of tools.</p>

<p>As an <strong>interactive environment</strong> and <strong>notebook tool</strong> that promotes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>, SoS
allows you to perform and record your analysis in different languages in a single <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>, with seamless integration
of multiple Jupyter kernels (e.g. python, and <a href="https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel">R</a>). The ability toexchange data between different kernels allows you to use the most appropriate languages for different parts of your work.</p>

<h1 id="Mixed-Style-Workflows">Mixed Style Workflows<a class="anchor-link" href="#Mixed-Style-Workflows">&#182;</a></h1><p>SoS follows your definition of workflow that allows you to define workflows in both foward and makefile style, even a mixture of both. More specifically, you can define workflows as ordered steps that would be executed sequentially step by step to process specified input files; or as a set of makefile-style rules that would be executed to generated specified output files; or as a sequence of steps with help from makefile-style steps. SoS automatically analyzes the input and output of steps and execute workflows using a dynamic DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that would be expanded and shrinked during the execution.</p>

<p>SoS separates the execution of workflows as individual <strong>execution units</strong> and record the signature of the execution units during the execution of the workflow. A highly intelligent signature system will ignore execution units if they have been executed and are being re-executed with identical input, output, dependent files, user parameters, and even environment variables. The execution units are indepedent of workflows so some steps of your workflow could be ignored if they have been executed by another workflow.</p>

<p>SoS is very easy to learn so that you can start using it in minutes without having to learn any of the advanced features. As demonstrated in our <a href="doc/tutorials/Quick_Start_Guide.html">Quick Start Guide</a>, you can easily consolidate your scripts into an executable workflow using SoS and add more features to the script step by step if necessary. The multi-kernel feature of the Jupyter notebook is also easy to use with only two magics to remember.</p>
